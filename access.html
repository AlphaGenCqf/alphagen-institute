    <h1>Research Access & Collaboration</h1>

    <p>
      AlphaGen research is developed as a <strong>diagnostic-first, audit-grade framework</strong>
      for regime-aware quantitative systems. Public papers and artifacts establish methodological
      clarity, reproducibility, and theoretical grounding.
    </p>

    <p>
      Deeper evaluation, system-level discussion, and deployment-oriented access are
      <strong>intentionally gated</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>What Is Public</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Working papers and conference research outputs</li>
      <li>Conceptual frameworks and diagnostic definitions</li>
      <li>Selected reproducible experimental artifacts</li>
      <li>High-level system architecture and validation logic</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What Is Restricted</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Full execution and capital-scaled risk pipelines</li>
      <li>Live regime-transition handling mechanisms</li>
      <li>Long-horizon coherence enforcement internals (Eterna)</li>
      <li>Institutional stress-testing and evaluation tooling</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Intended Collaborations</h2>
    <p>
      This research is designed for engagement with:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Quantitative hedge funds and proprietary trading desks</li>
      <li>Institutional research groups evaluating regime-aware systems</li>
      <li>Strategy research teams seeking diagnostic overlays rather than signal alpha</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This work is <strong>not intended</strong> for retail deployment, signal vending,
      or black-box licensing.
    </p>

    <h2>Engagement Model</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Independent review of public research</li>
      <li>Contextual discussion of regime and diagnostic assumptions</li>
      <li>Scoped evaluation access where appropriate</li>
      <li>Advisory or collaborative alignment if mutual fit exists</li>
    </ol>

    <p style="margin-top:40px; font-style:italic;">
      AlphaGen research should be read as part of a vertically ordered framework stack,
      not as isolated strategy proposals.
