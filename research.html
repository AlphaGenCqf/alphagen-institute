      Conceptual and Diagnostic Architecture of AlphaGen
    </p>
  </header>

  <!-- ================= OVERVIEW ================= -->
  <section>
    <p>
      AlphaGen’s research program is organized as a layered framework for studying
      financial markets as adaptive, non-stationary systems. Rather than proposing
      isolated models, the institute develops interconnected conceptual,
      diagnostic, and operational layers that together explain market behavior
      under regime uncertainty.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= FRAMEWORK STACK ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Framework Stack</h2>

    <p>
      The AlphaGen research architecture can be understood as a progression from
      generative context to observable outcomes:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Cognitive context shaping agent behavior</li>
      <li>Divergence between belief and realized structure</li>
      <li>Regime formation and transition</li>
      <li>Adaptive system response and stability</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= COGNITIVE WOMB ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Cognitive Womb</h2>
    <p>
      The <em>Cognitive Womb</em> is a conceptual construct describing the latent
      informational and structural environment within which trading strategies,
      beliefs, and decision rules are formed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It formalizes the idea that strategies are not static objects, but products
      of regime-conditioned cognitive constraints. Changes in market structure
      alter the Cognitive Womb, thereby reshaping the space of viable strategies
      before performance degradation becomes observable.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= BRD ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Belief–Reality Divergence (BRD)</h2>
    <p>
      Belief–Reality Divergence quantifies the persistent mismatch between
      expectation-implied market structure and realized outcomes. BRD accumulates
      when beliefs remain misaligned with evolving regimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather than serving as a predictive signal, BRD functions as a diagnostic
      state variable indicating internal market stress and impending regime
      reorganization.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= REGIME DIAGNOSTICS ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Regime Diagnostics</h2>
    <p>
      Regime diagnostics translate abstract divergence and cognitive context into
      observable market states characterized by volatility, correlation,
      liquidity, and stability profiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      This layer enables systematic identification of regime persistence,
      transition dynamics, and structural instability.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= ADAPTIVE SYSTEMS ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Adaptive Quantitative Systems</h2>
    <p>
      Adaptive systems within AlphaGen research respond to diagnosed regime
      conditions rather than raw price signals. Strategy behavior is conditioned
      on regime state, divergence measures, and stability diagnostics.
    </p>
    <p>
      This approach prioritizes controlled adaptation and failure transparency
      over continuous parameter optimization.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= INTEGRATION ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Integrated Research Flow</h2>
    <p>
      Together, these layers form an integrated research pipeline:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Cognitive Womb defines the generative context</li>
      <li>BRD measures internal divergence</li>
      <li>Regime diagnostics classify market state</li>
      <li>Adaptive systems respond within audited constraints</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This structure allows AlphaGen to study not only market outcomes, but the
      internal dynamics that precede instability and structural change.
