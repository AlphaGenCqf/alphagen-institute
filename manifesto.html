    <h1>The AlphaGen Manifesto</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Principles for Adaptive, Audit-Grade Financial Research</p>
  </header>

  <!-- ================= PREAMBLE ================= -->
  <section>
    <p>
      Financial markets are commonly modeled as stable or weakly perturbed
      statistical systems. In practice, they evolve through structural breaks,
      regime transitions, and belief-driven feedback loops that violate
      stationarity assumptions. This manifesto articulates the principles
      governing AlphaGen’s approach to financial research under such conditions.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= LIMITS OF PREDICTION ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>1. On the Limits of Prediction</h2>
    <p>
      AlphaGen rejects the assumption that improved predictive accuracy alone
      constitutes scientific progress in finance. In non-stationary environments,
      prediction error often reflects structural regime mismatch rather than model
      inadequacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consequently, AlphaGen prioritizes diagnostic understanding of when and why
      models fail over incremental improvements in short-horizon forecast metrics.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= REGIME AWARENESS ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>2. Regime Awareness as a First-Class Object</h2>
    <p>
      Markets transition between regimes characterized by distinct volatility,
      liquidity, correlation, and behavioral structures. Treating regimes as
      latent but inferable states is central to AlphaGen research.
    </p>
    <p>
      Models that ignore regime dependence conflate structural change with noise,
      leading to false confidence and brittle decision systems.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= COGNITIVE CONTEXT ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>3. Cognitive Context and Strategy Formation</h2>
    <p>
      Trading strategies do not exist independently of their informational and
      belief-conditioned environments. AlphaGen introduces the concept of a
      <em>Cognitive Womb</em> to describe the generative context in which strategies
      emerge, adapt, and stabilize.
    </p>
    <p>
      This perspective reframes strategy behavior as an outcome of regime-driven
      cognitive constraints rather than a fixed mapping from signals to actions.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= DIAGNOSTICS OVER OPTIMIZATION ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>4. Diagnostics Over Optimization</h2>
    <p>
      AlphaGen emphasizes diagnostic variables—such as belief–reality divergence,
      regime stress, and structural coherence—over blind optimization of objective
      functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Optimization without diagnostics risks amplifying hidden instabilities and
      obscuring the true sources of model fragility.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= AUDIT-GRADE STANDARDS ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>5. Audit-Grade Research Standards</h2>
    <p>
      Research outputs produced under the AlphaGen framework are designed to be
      auditable, interpretable, and reproducible. This includes explicit
      assumptions, documented failure modes, and transparent evaluation criteria.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Explicit modeling assumptions</li>
      <li>Clear regime definitions and transitions</li>
      <li>Reproducible computational artifacts</li>
      <li>Diagnostic reporting alongside results</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= REPRODUCIBILITY ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>6. Reproducibility as a Scientific Obligation</h2>
    <p>
      AlphaGen treats reproducibility not as a supplementary feature but as a
      foundational requirement. Where possible, research is accompanied by code,
      data descriptors, and diagnostic outputs enabling independent verification.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= INDEPENDENCE ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>7. Institutional Independence</h2>
    <p>
      AlphaGen operates independently of asset management, execution, or product
      distribution incentives. This independence enables methodological rigor
      without pressure to optimize for commercial narratives.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= CLOSING ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Closing Statement</h2>
    <p>
      AlphaGen’s mission is not to predict markets, but to understand their
      structure, diagnose their instabilities, and contribute durable scientific
      frameworks for adaptive financial intelligence.
